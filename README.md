# graduate_work
This repository includes some code and projects I have completed during my graduate career.

The following file names include code that I made to complete homework assignments for a Clous and Aerosol Chemistry and Physics course, ATS 772 at Colorado State University:
    activation.m
    kohler_theory.m
    OA_partitoning_aging.m
    Sulfate_nitrate_ammonia_dynamics.m



I will upload my masters thesis and corresponding code after June 24 when I have defended.
